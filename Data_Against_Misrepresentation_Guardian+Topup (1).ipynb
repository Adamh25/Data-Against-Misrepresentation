By releasing a slew of classic mixtapes over the last decade, the 32-year-old had built a reputation as one of the most skilled writers in UK rap. On paper, the album was a career high, achieved against the odds. First, it has no guest features. Rappers often use collaborations to maximise their streaming audiences, but not this time, no need. The album\\u2019s binding style, introduced by the singles Blame Brexit, Multifaceted, Corner Boy and White Ash, upheld its creator\\u2019s formula of undiluted hip-hop, avoiding any urge to chase a softened sound for primetime radio play. \\u201cI\\u2019m never looking for the next hit. It\\u2019s always just my expression, and I don\\u2019t like to waste it,\\u201d says Potter Payper, real name Jamel Bousbaa. We meet at a recording studio in Camden Town, north London, where he arrives with a younger sibling who has just received their GCSE results. He tells me proudly about how well they\\u2019ve done as we take our seats in the kitchen. Most remarkable was Real Back in Style\\u2019s timing, days into a two-month spell for Bousbaa at Pentonville prison. It was his 15th time inside since his early teens, and a return he thought he\\u2019d never make, given his meteoric rise as a commercial artist since he was last released in 2020. I am told by his PR before we meet that he doesn\\u2019t want to share why he was arrested \\u2013 it\\u2019s the only topic of conversation off the table. I gather that after years of being an open book in his lyrics, he\\u2019s preparing to batten down the hatches, avoiding media judgment until things have calmed down. Nonetheless, he hints at wrong-place-wrong-time circumstances. \\u201cI\\u2019d been back in the country eight or nine hours. I\\u2019d been on holiday in Morocco for a month doing Ramadan. I went to get some food, I was with my mate in a car, and for whatever reason the police wanted to stop the car, and they sent me to jail. But they had to let me go because it really wasn\\u2019t anything to do with me,\\u201d he says. As fans digested the latest chapter of his storytelling \\u2013 a home blend of sensitive autobiographical woe and raspy braggadocio laid over crisp, cinematic production \\u2013 Bousbaa sat in a cell studying Stoic philosophy to ward off negative thoughts. Others on his wing checked on the album\\u2019s progress. Prison officers came by to congratulate him on its chart position. \\u201cIt was like a kick in the nuts, that\\u2019s the only way to describe it. I was on such a smooth path,\\u201d he sighs, lighting up on a heated toaster. \\u201cI got through it. I was on the phone every day to the team, making sure they did what needed to be done.\\u201d Meet\\u2011and-greet pop-ups with fans took place across the capital, but without their star. An operation months in the making was thwarted. \\u201cComing out and being here now \\u2026 it\\u2019s underwhelming, in reality. I understand that I\\u2019ve been making mistakes all my life, and it\\u2019s been costing me all my life. Without getting too emotional about it, I missed a massive moment,\\u201d he says. \\u201cForget the success of it. Forget how it was received. My debut album release \\u2026 I wanted to be a part of that, to feel it.\\u201d Born in 1991 to an Irish mother and Algerian father, Bousbaa was raised by his grandmother, Nanny Lucy, on the notorious Gascoigne estate in Barking, straddling east London and Essex. Much of his lyricism, old and new, amounts to a brutally candid portrait of these years: \\u201cWhen I was little I weren\\u2019t scared of the Boogeyman / I was scared of scumbag police\\u2005in\\u2005a bully van,\\u201d he begins on When I Was Little. \\u201cHitting\\u2005robberies on Ilford Lane where the\\u2005hookers hang / Tryna get those kicks Nanny said that I couldn\\u2019t\\u205fhave.\\u201d \\u201cIt was London estate living, but with added brokeness,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI grew up around a lot of drugs, a lot of violence. I became desensitised to a lot of stuff very early and was geared towards having the capacity to fulfil a role as a drug dealer who could be violent to survive and thrive in that kind of environment. That\\u2019s what was necessary. Now, looking back, I ask myself: if I have a son, would I want him growing up like that? The answer is: hell no. But I grew up in a different time. My parents were immigrants, each escaping their respective traumas.\\u201d Having fair skin meant being a minority in a migrant community, yet Bousbaa carried an Islamic name in a part of the country rampant with white nationalism and racism. He was entangled in a web of identity crises from birth. \\u201cIt was always: \\u2018You\\u2019re not Black, you\\u2019re not white,\\u2019\\u201d he says, noting that, even now, he self-identifies as African, but not everyone sees him that way. \\u201cI struggled with who I was and where I was from.\\u201d Family breakdown overwhelmed him. \\u201cCold nights sleeping on the ground floor / I don\\u2019t hate my father, I just wish he was around more,\\u201d he raps on one of his earliest and most celebrated songs, Purple Rain, later adding: \\u201c\\u201999 they said my mummy went on holiday / I found out that my mummy was in Holloway.\\u201d But between playing out with friends and his grandmother\\u2019s love, life could also be sweet, and language became an escape. In primary school, Bousbaa came across the word \\u201cponder\\u201d and asked his teacher what it meant. \\u201cThey said: \\u2018It means to think about something.\\u2019 I replied: \\u2018Why not just say: \\u2018To think about something\\u2019, then?\\u2019 And they told me that there are different words that mean the same thing. My mind was blown.\\u201d He went home and found a thesaurus. His aunt was studying to be a lawyer, and he would steal her university books to learn new words to use around adults. \\u201cI used to like being a smart arse. It was an easy way to get a compliment,\\u201d he grins. As a teenager, he was pushed by the forces of poverty and a turbulent home life and pulled by territorial, quick-money pressures towards criminality. He was sent to Feltham young offender institution in west London, a sprawling labyrinth of barred, windy walkways that link wings named after bird breeds \\u2013 \\u201cJust a kid on Eagle, had to miss my people,\\u201d he raps \\u2013 and cells from which you can see the aeroplanes taking off from Heathrow. Over the years, the prison has become a rite of passage for makers of UK rap and drill music. \\u201cOften the people who end up here have left schools that weren\\u2019t catering for music. Life could have been different if they\\u2019d had that experience,\\u201d says Phil Jones, who has taught music at Feltham for 23 years. He remembers Jamel passing through the education department\\u2019s doors \\u2013 one of hundreds he\\u2019s seen who would take to rapping. \\u201cPeople might not make a career out of playing an instrument, but it allows them to gain confidence, learn something and get more culturally minded. Music is a lifeline and a competition \\u2026 a deep therapy that takes them into a zone. The guys who are writing more thinking man\\u2019s stuff, they feel they\\u2019ve got a duty to do so.\\u201d When Bousbaa arrived, people would gather during \\u201csosh\\u201d, or association time, to take turns spitting their lyrics in cyphers. Because he was from east London, the nucleus of grime music\\u2019s inception during its golden years in the mid-2000s, he delivered his words faster than everyone else. His peers were more taken with the slow, pronounced flows of what is now labelled \\u201croad\\u201d or \\u201creal\\u201d rap \\u2013 the British equivalent of gangsta rap. Back then it was a hardened, subterranean sound in its infancy, pioneered by regional groups from across the capital such as Northstar, PDC and Mashtown, and later popularised by Giggs, who would become a mentor to Potter in the mid-2010s. \\u201cA mate said to me: \\u2018Bro, you should slow it down a bit, you can say more and be taken more seriously.\\u2019 And all I wanted at that age was to be taken seriously,\\u201d Bousbaa says. In between penning long letters to Nanny Lucy \\u2013 he has a tattoo of her signature on the side of his face \\u2013 he listened to American rappers such as Styles P and Cam\\u2019ron. Over subsequent trips to prison he met teachers who helped him dissect the poetry of Tupac and rhyme schemes of Eminem. \\u201cThis teacher said to me: \\u2018Eminem doesn\\u2019t rhyme words, he rhymes syllables.\\u2019 Then he showed me on a piece of paper how to do it: \\u2018That-is-real, mass-app-eal, hands-to-kill.\\u2019 I still use that same formula of writing today,\\u201d he says. \\u201cThat\\u2019s like my magic, my secret ingredient, but I don\\u2019t hoard it.\\u201d Being caught in the revolving door of the criminal justice system for the best part of two decades would become a \\u201cgift and a curse\\u201d, he admits. \\u201cI had nothing but time to sit there, write, rap and perfect that, rather than get a job or live real life.\\u201d Potter Payper\\u2019s artist name was an accident: his long-held nickname, a reference to everyone\\u2019s favourite boy wizard with rimmed glasses, was mistakenly placed next to the word \\u201cPayper\\u201d in the labelling of a song. He decided to keep it. His friend had the keys to a youth club and encouraged him to start recording there. Bousbaa was offered the chance to do freestyle videos for underground music hubs, catapulting his name into hood fame among music aficionados. In 2013, he released his debut mixtape, Training Day. Inspired by the DIY attitude of the late California rapper-entrepreneur Nipsey Hussle and the co-founder of Nike, Phil \\u201cShoe Dog\\u201d Knight, he pressed up 1,500 CDs and drove around London selling them from the boot of his car. \\u201cAt that time I thought I was going to the edge of the Earth, but it was probably just Knightsbridge,\\u201d he laughs. The mixtape\\u2019s title referenced the 2001 film in which Denzel Washington\\u2019s corrupt detective takes Ethan Hawke\\u2019s young recruit under his wing. \\u201cIn the film, my man [the recruit] is naive,\\u201d Bousbaa says. \\u201cHe wants to be the hero. But then he sees that everything he believed wasn\\u2019t what it was. It\\u2019s ruthless, people are out here for themselves, it\\u2019s dangerous. It\\u2019ll be the person you\\u2019re supposed to trust the most, your partner, who in the end could be your downfall. That was me in the beginning of that street journey. I was just out here on the roads, a little kid, and as it went on I got more and more entrenched in a life that was never really for me. I\\u2019m a better musician and asset to the music industry than I ever was a drug dealer.\\u201d The Training Day trilogy would form the backbone of Potter Payper\\u2019s subsequent rise. It was shortly after the release of Training Day 2 in December 2016 that he was sentenced to four years in prison for his participation in county lines drugs trafficking (serving two of them). He was a victim of his own lyrics after his brags about drug dealing were used against him in court. This phenomenon was, back then, relatively rare, but has since become normalised as police seem to mine online content for evidence of criminal guilt and gang membership. In 2020, Training Day 3 came out on the same day that Nanny Lucy died. \\u201cIt was a massive moment, like a right and a left hook, bam bam,\\u201d Bousbaa says, acting out the punches. As he reckoned with loss and new familial responsibilities, his mixtape soared to No 3 in the UK charts. \\u201cIt completely changed my life, my perspective on how people perceive me, and how people treated me within this industry,\\u201d he says. The following year, he was signed by 0207 Def Jam, the new UK division of Def Jam Recordings. \\u201cIt was the right move \\u2026 I needed stability. I just wanted to be legit,\\u201d he says. His first mixtape released with their backing, Thanks for Waiting, went to No 8 in the UK charts. Its soulful lead single Gangsteritus, featuring hook specialist Tiggs Da Author, became Bousbaa\\u2019s first UK Top 40 hit. It is now his most recognisable and streamed song, its inclusion at the tragic climax of Netflix television show Top Boy season four last year made his voice synonymous with London\\u2019s exported street culture around the world. To help steward Bousbaa as he worked towards his debut album, Kwame \\u201cKZ\\u201d Kwei-Armah Jr, a multi-award-winning producer who has worked with the likes of Stormzy and Amaarae, and on films such as Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, was hired as exec and additional producer. \\u201cWords never escape him,\\u201d KZ says, of Potter. \\u201cHe\\u2019s one of the best poets I\\u2019ve worked with.\\u201d KZ brought live musical elements into the studio \\u2013 horns, strings, electric guitars, drums \\u2013 to elevate Potter\\u2019s words. He was impressed by how Potter was committed to involving his own circle of producers and turned down some big names to finish on his own terms. \\u201cWe would have meetings about what he wanted, what he wasn\\u2019t prepared to compromise on \\u2026 a lot of people don\\u2019t have those minerals. It\\u2019s a story of growth and triumph.\\u201d Real Back in Style is British rap at its most raw and refined, simultaneously. Its songs are full of cathartic purging, forensic self-criticism and musings on adapting to life as an unexpected star. \\u201cI got mental scars from this shit but we\\u2019re living off it,\\u201d he cries. \\u201cTenth floor in the stairs, we used to hide from the rain, fell in love with the life just to hide from the shame.\\u201d He ponders society\\u2019s ills \\u2013 \\u201cRapping about drillings and they\\u2019re killing civilians / Somebody take a look at the children, and heal them\\u201d \\u2013 and his storytelling is gripping and literary: \\u201cI waited in the block until I see lights hit the corner / I cut out the back and disappeared into the trauma.\\u201d Like many artists, he has become wary of letting higher powers into his creative process and becoming indebted to financial advances that take years to recoup. \\u201cI want to just build my own empire rather than building someone else\\u2019s \\u2026 I don\\u2019t ever want to lose myself, and money is one of the quickest ways,\\u201d he says. He misses his old, tried-and-tested way of making music and releasing it into the world independently, without the glitz. This year, Bousbaa has laid verses on other charting artists\\u2019 projects: he was one of only a few features on Digga D\\u2019s latest album, Back to Square One, and the only guest verse on Manchester rapper Tunde\\u2019s Top 10 mixtape First Lap, whose video was shot a week after Bousbaa went to Pentonville and features a phone call from him at the start. Having launched his own imprint, 36 the Label, and signed veteran south Londoner Fee Gonzalez, Bousbaa says he wants to try his hand at talent-spotting as an A&amp;R. Throughout our interview, in the room next door, Blade Brown has been working on a verse for a song also featuring Skrapz \\u2013 both top-tier UK rappers \\u2013 that will contribute towards Bousbaa\\u2019s next project. This time, he explains, it will be full of features, demonstrating the breadth and variety of his artistic network. Going forward, he is passionate about helping the UK rap scene edge closer to breaking America. He intends to never go to prison again. \\u201cThe difference now is that I don\\u2019t fit in there any more as a person. Which is a bittersweet moment, because it means you\\u2019ve grown, you\\u2019ve bettered yourself, and that\\u2019s commendable,\\u201d he concludes. \\u201cBut that\\u2019s like going back to your ends and realising that you don\\u2019t belong there no more.\\u201d Real Back in Style is out now.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2020-01-01 00:01:49+00:00\",\n        \"max\": \"2025-10-19 08:00:08+00:00\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 28735,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2025-09-16 04:00:27+00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 29311,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/17/yemeni-cafes-us-muslim-dating-relationships\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"faith_group\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"jewish\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
